# DSA Assignment in Java
Assigment Submitted by Hammad Ahmed 2K24/CSE/62
This repository contains Java programs for a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment. Each program demonstrates a specific concept and includes example usage.

## Programs Included

### 1. Reverse an Array Using a Stack
* **File:** `ReverseArrayWithStack.java`
* **Description:** This program reverses an array by pushing all its elements onto a stack and then popping them back into the array. The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) property of the stack naturally reverses the order of the elements.

### 2. Parentheses Matching Using a Stack
* **File:** `ParenthesesMatcher.java`
* **Description:** This program checks if the parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}` in a given string are balanced and correctly nested. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and matches them with closing ones.

### 3. Recursive Sum of an Array
* **File:** `RecursiveSum.java`
* **Description:** This program calculates the sum of all elements in an integer array using a recursive function. The base case is an empty array (sum is 0), and the recursive step is adding the current element to the sum of the rest of the array.

## How to Compile and Run

You can compile and run these programs using a Java Development Kit (JDK).

1.  **Compile a program:**
    ```sh
    javac FileName.java
    ```
    *Replace `FileName` with the name of the file you want to compile (e.g., `javac ReverseArrayWithStack.java`).*

2.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```sh
    java ClassName
    ```
    *Replace `ClassName` with the name of the public class (e.g., `java ReverseArrayWithStack`).*
